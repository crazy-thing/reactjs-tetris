# About

This Tetris game was my first web development project for my senior year of high school using React. I'm finished with this for now, but have lots of things I would like to improve on in the future.

# Features
- Your normal Tetris features such as rotating and placing tetrominoes
- Fast dropping
- Previews
- Holding
- Score history

# Future Improvements
I've learned a lot since creating this project and the main thing I would do is clean up and refactor the code.

#### Additions
- Animations
- Better Menu
- Settings
- Multiplayer
- Mobile Support
- Responsive Design
